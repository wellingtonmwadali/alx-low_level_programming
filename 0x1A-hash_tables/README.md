What is a hash function?
A hash function is a mathematical algorithm that takes an input (such as a key) and produces a fixed-size output called a hash value or hash code. The purpose of a hash function is to efficiently map data of arbitrary size to a unique or nearly unique hash value. Hash functions are commonly used in hash tables to determine the index or position where data should be stored.

What makes a good hash function?
A good hash function has the following characteristics:

It should be deterministic, meaning that the same input will always produce the same hash value.
It should be efficient to compute the hash value for any input.
It should uniformly distribute the hash values across the entire range of possible hash values.
It should minimize the number of collisions, where two different inputs produce the same hash value.
It should exhibit the avalanche effect, where a small change in the input produces a significantly different hash value.
What is a hash table? How do they work and how to use them?
A hash table, also known as a hash map, is a data structure that provides efficient insertion, deletion, and retrieval operations. It uses a hash function to transform keys into array indices, allowing for direct access to the corresponding values. The basic idea is to store key-value pairs in an array, where the index for each pair is determined by applying the hash function to the key.

To use a hash table, follow these steps:

Create an empty hash table.
Define or select a hash function appropriate for the keys you will use.
Insert key-value pairs into the hash table by applying the hash function to the keys and storing the values at the resulting indices.
Retrieve values by providing the corresponding keys to the hash table, which uses the hash function to determine the storage location.
What is a collision? How are collisions handled in the context of a hash table?
A collision occurs when two or more distinct keys produce the same hash value or index in a hash table. Collisions are unavoidable due to the finite size of the underlying array and the infinite number of possible hash values.

The main ways of handling collisions in a hash table are:

Separate Chaining: Each element in the array maintains a linked list of key-value pairs that hashed to the same index. Colliding elements are appended to the linked list at the corresponding index, allowing multiple elements to coexist at the same index.
Open Addressing: When a collision occurs, the hash table looks for the next available slot in the array using probing techniques like linear probing, quadratic probing, or double hashing. These methods search for alternative slots to place the colliding elements until an empty slot is found.
Advantages and drawbacks of using hash tables
Advantages of using hash tables include:

Fast average-case time complexity for insertion, deletion, and retrieval operations (O(1)).
Efficient for storing and retrieving data based on
