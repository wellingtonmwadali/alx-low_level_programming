A dynamic library, also known as a shared library, is a separate file containing compiled code 
that can be loaded and linked with an application during runtime.
Dynamic libraries provide a way to share code among multiple applications,
allowing for modularity and efficient use of system resources.

Here's an overview of how dynamic libraries work, how to create one, and how to use it:

Creating a Dynamic Library:

Write the code:
Create the functions and modules you want to include in the library. 
This code should be compiled into object files (e.g., using a C/C++ compiler).
Create the shared library: Use a linker to combine the object files into a shared library file.
The process varies depending on the platform and development environment you're using. 
Common tools include gcc or ld for Unix-like systems and link.exe for Windows.


Using a Dynamic Library:

Linking:
When compiling an application that uses a dynamic library, you need to specify the library to link against.
The specific steps may depend on your development environment, but typically involve specifying the library name or
path during the compilation or linking stage.

Loading the library: At runtime, the operating system or runtime environment loads the dynamic library file into memory. 
This can be done implicitly by the operating system or explicitly through code.

Resolving symbols: When an application calls a function or references a variable from the dynamic library, the operating 
system resolves the symbol, which means it locates the memory address of the required function or variable within the library.

Execution: The application can now execute the functions and use the variables defined in the dynamic
 library as if they were part of the application's code.
